# Ambiance

Universal cognitive prosthetic with autonomous AI entity - sensory layer for cyber-physical intelligence.

## Overview

Ambiance transforms autonomous AI orchestration from purely digital to cyber-physical by giving the AI entity persistent sensory awareness through Meta Ray-Ban glasses. The system maintains continuous context across all life domains and proactively accelerates progress on what matters most.

## Architecture

```
META GLASSES → PERCEPTION LAYER → zeOS MEMORY → AI DIRECTORS → WORKERS
```

- **Sensory Input**: Camera, microphone, GPS, accelerometer
- **Edge Processing**: Privacy-first, local data processing
- **AI Orchestration**: Director-worker coordination for autonomous operation
- **Output**: HUD overlays, audio feedback, task automation

## Key Features

- **Universal Context**: Continuous awareness across personal, professional, and creative domains
- **Privacy-First**: Local processing with explicit consent boundaries
- **Autonomous Learning**: System discovers new capabilities from physical world input
- **zeOS Integration**: Built on proven AI orchestration and persistence infrastructure

## Development Status

**Phase 1**: Foundation and infrastructure setup *(Current)*  
**Phase 2**: Perception layer and autonomous triggers  
**Phase 3**: Full autonomous operation and multi-user federation
